This is your test:

As developer, I want a tool to list unused AWS resources to save costs. The tool input is a list of tags and it returns the list of EC2 instances and S3 buckets that don't match any of the tags in the N. Virginia region.

Write the tool using Python 3.

Implement some automatic tests to verify that the tool works as expected. 

Use Terraform to create resources to validate the tool works as expected.

Package the application as a Docker image, so the user doesn't have to install python and other packages locally.

Publish your code in a public GitHub repository, and share a Pull Request with your code. Do not merge into master until the PR is approved.

Include documentation describing the steps to run and test the automation.
